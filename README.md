# Flask Processing App

This is a simple Flask app that shows how to have a button run a specific Python function.

99% of the existing Flask tutorials focus on building database apps, which over complicates the process of learning Flask.

I was only able to learn how to use Flask after building an application that focused purely on a processing task.
